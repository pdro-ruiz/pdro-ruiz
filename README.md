### üëã Hello! 

I'm Pedro, passionate about discovering hidden patterns, obtaining valuable information and using it in potential business applications.
My goal is to use my analytical skills and experience in handling large volumes of data to solve complex problems.

I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from exploratory data analysis to building and deploying machine learning models. 
These projects have given me the opportunity to work with large datasets, clean and preprocess data, explore and visualize data for insights, build and refine predictive models.

(PORTFOLIO)

In this portfolio, you will find a selection of my data science projects. Each project is a representation of my analytical approach to problem solving and my ability to communicate results effectively. The projects vary in terms of complexity and area of focus, but they all demonstrate my ability to use data to gain insights and make decisions.

In addition to my projects, you will also find certifications I have earned from recognized institutions. 

These certifications demonstrate my commitment to continuous learning and my dedication to staying current with the latest trends and techniques in the field of data science.

I am happy to share my work and am open to collaborative opportunities and roles that allow me to use my skills to make a positive impact. 
If you have any questions about my work or if you are interested in working with me, feel free to contact me.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoyed creating it.
